 @mainpage Design documentation

 Define a Custom UIView to depict the progress of a task over time.
 
 The amount of **progress** is displayed by a multiple colors horizontal bar
 that represents a range of values.
 
 The current **progress** is shown by the position of a cursor with a textual indication
 of the amount of the task that has completed, as its value or percentage:

 This Custom UIView can be created and instantiated both in-code
 (programmatically) or via a nib (storyboard).
