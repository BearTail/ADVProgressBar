 Define the `ADVPercentProgressBar` class, that is a Custom UIView to depict
 the progress of a task over time.
 
 The amount of **progress** is displayed by a multiple colors horizontal bar
 that represents a range of values.
 
 The current **progress** is shown by the position of a cursor with the textual
 indication of the amount of the task that has completed. The amount can be
 displayed as integral value or a percentage of it.
 
 The `ADVPercentProgressBar` class can be created and instantiated both in-code
 (programmatically) or via a nib (storyboard).
 

 Using the `ADVPercentProgressBar` Custom UIView
 -----------------------------------------------
 The `ADVPercentProgressBar` class is deployed together a demo app to show
 various use case scenarios. 
 @image html screenshot.jpg
 
 The custom UIView class and the demo app have been developed as an Xcode 4.5.2
 project for iPhone devices targeting iOS 5.0.
 
 To achieve the same demo app yourself, open Xcode and create a new project
 with the iOS\Application\Single View Application template and
 name it ADVProgressBar.
 Enter ADV as Class Prefix; make sure the Device Family is set to iPhone,
 Use Storyboard and Use Automatic Reference Counting are checked.
 
 Add `ADVPercentProgressBar.h` and `ADVPercentProgressBar.m` to your project.
 
 Open MainStoryboard.storyboard and go to Editor\Canvas\Show Bounds Rectangles
 (this will make it easier to see what weâ€™re doing).

 Then drag a UIView from the Object Library into the view controller,
 and resize it to look like the following:
 @image html storyboard0.jpg
 
 Then click on the UIView you added and go to the Identity Inspector.
 Set the class to `ADVPercentProgressBar`:

 Now connect this to outlets. Bring up the Assistant editor, and make sure that
 ADVViewController.h is visible and import the `ADVPercentProgressBar` header.
 Control-drag from the UIView down between the \@interface and \@end lines,
 connect it to an Outlet and named it `pbRangeValue`.

 Repeat this for an other `ADVPercentProgressBar` views, but connect it
 to an outlet called `pbRangePercent`.
 
 At this point ADVViewController.h should look like the following:
\code
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "ADVPercentProgressBar.h"

@interface ADVViewController : UIViewController

@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet ADVPercentProgressBar *pbRangeValue;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet ADVPercentProgressBar *pbRangePercent;

-(IBAction)sliderValueChanged:(UISlider*)sender;

@end
\endcode
