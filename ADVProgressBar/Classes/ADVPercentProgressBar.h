/*!
 ADVPercentProgressBar depicts the progress of a task over time.
 
 The amount of `progress` is displayed by a horizontal bar,
 called `progressImageView`, that represents a range of values.
 This range is controlled by the `minProgressValue` and the `maxProgressValue`
 properties, whose default values are 0.0 and 1.0 respectively.
 
 The user can customize the appearance of the `progressImageView` horizontal bar
 selecting its color in the `ADVProgressBarColor` set.
 
 The current `progress` is represented by a floating-point value (default 0.0)
 between `minProgressValue` and `maxProgressValue`, inclusive;
 values less or greater are pinned to those limits.
 
 The current `progress` is shown by the position of a cursor, coupled with
 the `progressImageView` and called `percentView`; within its bounds, it is
 shown a textual indication of the amount of the task that has completed.
 The way this indication is displayed, is controlled by the `showPercentage`
 property: by default its value is `true` and the current `progress` is
 formatted as a percent complete respect the range of values.
 
 The user can set to `false` the `showPercentage` property to display the integral
 amount of the task that has completed.
 Since the width of the `progressImageView` cursor is fixed to 3 textual
 characters wide, if `maxProgressValue` is greater than 999, then the current
 `progress` is formatted as a percent even if the `showPercentage` property
 is set to `false`.
 
 The `showPercentage` property isn't taken in account also when the
 `maxProgressValue` is less or equal to 1.0: the current `progress` will be
 always formatted as a percent.

/*!
 Initializes and returns a newly allocated `ADVPercentProgressBar` view object.
 
 The view is allocated with the specified frame rectangle and
 the `progressImageView` horizontal bar color.
 
 @param frame
    The frame rectangle for the view, measured in points.
    The origin of the frame is relative to the superview in which you plan to add it.
 
 @param barColor
    The `progressImageView` horizontal bar color in the `ADVProgressBarColor` set.
 
 @return
    An initialized `ADVPercentProgressBar` view object
    or nil if the object couldn't be created.
